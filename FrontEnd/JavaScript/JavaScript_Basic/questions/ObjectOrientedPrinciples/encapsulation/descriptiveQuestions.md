Benefits of encapsulation in JavaScript:

1) Data Security: Encapsulation helps in protecting the data by preventing direct access to private variables. This ensures that the data is not modified inappropriately.  
2) Code Reusability: Encapsulation makes it easier to reuse code since objects are self-contained and can be used in different parts of the application.  
3) Maintenance: Encapsulation makes it easier to maintain the code since objects are independent of each other and changes made to one object do not affect the others.
