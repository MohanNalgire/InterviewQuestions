| 9       | Factory Pattern               | Create a ShapeFactory class that produces different shapes based on input. Implement methods to create Circle and Square objects.                                                                 How would you modify the factory to support additional shapes in the future?                   |
| 10      | Decorator Pattern             | Implement a class Pizza and a decorator class ToppingDecorator to add toppings to the pizza. Explain how the decorator pattern enhances functionality.                                            How would you implement a method to calculate the total cost of the pizza with all toppings?   |
| 11      | Observer Pattern              | Create a class Subject that notifies observers when its state changes. Implement a simple observer class that reacts to these changes.

How would you handle circular references during serialization?                                 |
| 16      | Validation                    | Implement a class Form with methods to validate user input fields such as email and password. Ensure that appropriate error messages are returned for invalid input.                              How would you extend the validation to support custom validation rules?                        |


### class and object Basic
Question: create a class in JS as `product` that represents a product in an online store. The class should have the following properties:
1. `productId` - immutable
2. `productName` - mutable
3. `productPrice` - mutable
The class should provide the following methods:
1. getProductId() - Returns the immutable productId.
2. setProductName(name) - Allows you to change the productName.
3. setProductPrice(price) - Allows you to change the productPrice.
Implement the product class and demonstrate its functinality.
