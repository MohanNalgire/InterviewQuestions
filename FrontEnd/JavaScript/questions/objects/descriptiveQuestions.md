### question and answers

#### what are the kinds of object properties

In JavaScript, there are two kinds of object properties:

1) Data properties - 
2) Accessor properties - In JavaScript, accessor properties are methods that get or set the value of an object. 

1. Data property

```javascript
const student = {

    // data property
    firstName: 'Monica';
};
```

2. Accessor Property
>
In JavaScript, accessor properties are methods that get or set the value of an object. For that, we use these two keywords:

get - to define a getter method to get the property value
set - to define a setter method to set the property value

```javascript
const student = {

    // data property
    firstName: 'Monica',
    
    // accessor property(getter)
    get getName() {
        return this.firstName;
    }
    //accessor property(setter)
    set changeName(newName) {
        this.firstName = newName;
    }
};
// accessing data property
console.log(student.firstName); // Monica

// accessing getter methods
console.log(student.getName); // Monica

// trying to access as a method
console.log(student.getName()); // error
console.log(student.firstName); // Monica

// change(set) object property using a setter
student.changeName = 'Sarah';

console.log(student.firstName); // Sarah
```

#### When we said a function as object method in JavaScript

When the value is a function, the property becomes a method. Typically, you use methods to describe the objectâ€™s behaviors.
Example 1:

```javascript
let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe'
};
/*
person is a object and greet is person objects property
This is a exprssion function where the assigned value is function so here greet is a person objects method.
*/
person.greet = function () {
    console.log('Hello!');
}

person.greet();
```

Example 2

```javascript
let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe'
};

function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, World!');
}

person.greet = greet;

person.greet();
```

EXample 3

```javascript
let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    greet: function () {
        console.log('Hello, World!');
    }
};

ES6 
let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    greet() {
        console.log('Hello, World!');
    }
};

person.greet();
```
