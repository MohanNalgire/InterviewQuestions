### Which keywords are used in typescript for variable declarations? 

`var` => Variables in TypeScript can be declared using var keyword, same as in JavaScript. The scoping rules remains the same as in JavaScript.
`let` => To solve problems with var declarations, ES6 introduced two new types of variable declarations in JavaScript, using the keywords let and const. TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, also supports these new types of variable declarations.
`const` => Variables can be declared using const similar to var or let declarations. The const makes a variable a constant where its value cannot be changed. Const variables have the same scoping rules as let variables.
